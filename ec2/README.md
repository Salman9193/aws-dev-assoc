## Amazon EC2

- EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS’ offerings
- EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
- It mainly consists in the capability of:
  - Renting virtual machines (EC2)
  - Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
  - Distributing load across machines (ELB)
  - Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
- Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

## EC2 Sizing & Configuration Options

- Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows, or Mac OS
- How much compute power & cores (CPU)
- How much random-access memory (RAM)
- How much storage space:
  - Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
  - Hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
- Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
- Firewall rules: security group
- Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

## EC2 User Data

- It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script.
- Bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
- That script is only run once at the instance's first start
- EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
  - Installing updates
  - Installing software
  - Downloading common files from the internet
  - Anything you can think of
- The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user

## EC2 Instance Types - Overview

- You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimized for different use cases ([AWS EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/))
- AWS has the following naming convention:
  - `m`: instance class
  - `5`: generation (AWS improves them over time)
  - `2xlarge`: size within the instance class

## EC2 Instance Types – General Purpose

- Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
- Balance between:
  - Compute
  - Memory
  - Networking
- In the course, we will be using the `t2.micro` which is a General Purpose EC2 instance

## EC2 Instance Types – Compute Optimized

- Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors:
  - Batch processing workloads
  - Media transcoding
  - High performance web servers
  - High performance computing (HPC)
  - Scientific modeling & machine learning
  - Dedicated gaming servers

## EC2 Instance Types – Memory Optimized

- Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
- Use cases:
  - High performance, relational/non-relational databases
  - Distributed web scale cache stores
  - In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence)
  - Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

## EC2 Instance Types – Storage Optimized

- Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
- Use cases:
  - High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
  - Relational & NoSQL databases
  - Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
  - Data warehousing applications
  - Distributed file systems

## EC2 Instance Types: Example

| Instance    | vCPU | Mem (GiB) | Storage          | Network Performance | EBS Bandwidth (Mbps) |
|-------------|------|-----------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| t2.micro    | 1    | 1         | EBS-Only         | Low to Moderate     |                      |
| t2.xlarge   | 4    | 16        | EBS-Only         | Moderate            |                      |
| c5d.4xlarge | 16   | 32        | 1 x 400 NVMe SSD | Up to 10 Gbps       | 4,750                |
| r5.16xlarge | 64   | 512       | EBS Only         | 20 Gbps             | 13,600               |
| m5.8xlarge  | 32   | 128       | EBS Only         | 10 Gbps             | 6,800                |
